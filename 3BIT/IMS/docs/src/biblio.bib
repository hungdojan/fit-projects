abstract = {Growth of filamentous fungi on the surface of cereal grains is a critical aspect of solid substrate fermentation (SSF). Numerous mathematical models have been developed to describe various aspects of fungal growth in SSF. These models consider hyphal geometry and nutrient availability as determinants of colony morphology and fungal physiological state. This work describes the use of cellular automata (CA) as an alternative method of modeling fungal growth. CA models reliant on a very limited set of rules or “knowledge base” display a rich array of behaviors that mimic fungal growth. By incorporating probablistic growth rules into CA models, colony characteristics such as biomass accumulation rate, colony radial growth rate, mycelial density and fungal differentiation are readily generated.}

    abstract = "{This work examines nutritional influence on fungal colony growth and biomass distribution in response to toxic metals. In low-substrate solid medium, 0.1 mM Cd, Cu and Zn caused a decrease in radial expansion of both Trichoderma viride and Rhizopus arrhizus. However, as the amount of available carbon source (glucose) increased, the apparent toxicity of the metals decreased. These metals also affected the overall length of the fungal mycelium and branching patterns. In low-nutrient conditions, T. viride showed a decrease in overall mycelial length and number of branches in response to Cu, resulting in an extremely sparsely branched colony. Conversely, although Cd also reduced overall mycelial length to about one-third of the control length, the number of branches decreased only slightly which resulted in a highly branched colony with many aberrant features. Cu and Cd induced similar morphological changes in R. arrhizus. A large-scale mycelial-mapping technique showed that disruption of normal growth by Cu and Cd resulted in altered biomass distribution within the colony. When grown on metal-free low-substrate medium, T. viride showed an even distribution of biomass within the colony with some allocation to the periphery. However, Cu caused most of the biomass to be allocated to the colony periphery, while in the presence of Cd, most biomass was located at the interior of the colony. These results imply that such alterations of growth and resource allocation by Cu and Cd may influence success in locating nutrients as well as survival, and that these metals have individual and specific effects on the growing fungus.}",

@article{differentiation,
issn = {0006-3592},
abstract = {Mold growth and differentiation are closely related to the formation of secondary products. In solid‐substrate fermentations this interrelationship is often more completely realized than in submerged cultures. Solid substrate reactions are used commercially in a limited manner in the western world, but are relatively common in Asia. Basic studies in solid‐substrate fermentation should yield results applicable to all types of commercial mold fermentations for the production of a secondary product. This paper presents a relatively simple model for the growth of a mold colony on a solid surface with a defined medium utilizing glucose. Unlike submerged cultures the model must account for both cellular differentiation and the spatial heterogeneity in the system. Model parameters were estimated independently using literature values. The results of the simulation studies suggest that mass transfer limitations are at least partially responsible for the proliferation of differentiated structures on solid substrates as compared to liquid cultures. Since the concentration profile depends on the depth of the substratum, conditions that enhance conidia production can be achieved by controlling the depth of the solid medium.},
